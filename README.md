# Chrome Dinosaur Game

This is a simple clone of the classic Chrome Dinosaur game, implemented in Java using Swing. The game is inspired by the endless running game that appears in the Chrome browser when there is no internet connection. The objective is to control a dinosaur and avoid obstacles (cacti) to score points.

## How to Play
- Press the space bar to make the dinosaur jump.
- Avoid cacti to keep running and increase your score.
- If the dinosaur hits a cactus, the game ends, but you can press space to restart.

## How to Compile and Run
1. **Compile**: Use a terminal to navigate to the directory with your source files and compile with the following command:
   ```sh
   javac App.java ChromeDinosaur.java
   ```

2. **Run**: After compiling, run the game with:
   ```sh
   java App
   ```
